;;; FAILED EXPERIMENT. Or rather, unfinished. I found it easier just to use 
;;;   https://gitlab.common-lisp.net/dkochmanski/metering.
;;;   See #P"with-metering for lispworks.txt"

;;; Tools for metering lisp functions and methods in Lispworks. (Should still work in CCL too.)
;;; NOTE: This records wall-clock time in microseconds, while the CCL version records CPU time in microseconds.
;;; Based on CCL-metering.lisp

;;; This code also has the very useful feature that it enables one to meter individual
;;;   methods of a generic function separately, where MK's does not.
;;;   (Of course, metering regular functions is also still supported).

;;; This operates by essentially wrapping some advice around each metered method or function.
;;; The function #'meter accepts the same syntax as #'advise except it takes fewer args
;;;   since it already knows precisely what extra work it needs to do before and after the nominal
;;;   function.
;;; The function #'meter* works just like #'meter except when you give it a symbol referring to a
;;;   generic function it automatically calls #'meter on all its methods.
;;; The main user interface is #'with-metering.

;;; See examples at the end.

New overhead strategy.
Any given function must:

Keep track of its own overhead, defined as 
its overall time minus its delta-time, where delta-time
is the time taken by just its "meat".
Call this "my-overhead." Add that to *total-overhead* at the END
of the function.

Of course delta-time includes the overhead of CALLED metered
functions too, but we don't care about this, because we will
have already subtracted out ALL of delta-time in our overhead
calculations. (The called metered functions will have appropriately
incremented *total-overhead* themselves, by the time we get
to the end of ourself.)

Note that we do NOT need to remove overhead of CALLED metered functions
in our own calculations, because we assume *total-time* will have been properly
updated by our callees to NOT include their own overhead.

To make this assumption true, we back out our own overhead from our own
updating of *total-time* and thus the assumption becomes true by induction.

We really need to do all the above for consing-overhead too, but that will come later.
|#

#|
Note about atomic-incf and atomic-decf below.
If a given function is being metered in more than one thread simultaneously, it's important to increment and decrement
metering counts atomically. Otherwise, incorrect counts can result.

It would be even better to lock the entire stats structure during the execution of meter-global-def,
but that would require a lock and waiting for locks inside metering code seems like a very bad idea.
In most metering scenarios, a lack of consistency between elements of a given stats struct is probably not a big deal, because
you shouldn't be checking a given stats structure until all metering uses of it are done and you're reporting the results. By
that time, the structure will be self-consistent again.

It's still likely that *total-time* and overhead calculations will be bogus here when calls in multiple threads are being metered.
